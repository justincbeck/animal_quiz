It works like this. The program starts by telling the user to think of an animal. It then begins asking a series of
yes/no questions about that animal: does it swim, does it have hair, etc. Eventually, it will narrow down the
possibilities to a single animal and guess that (Is it a mouse?).

If the program has guessed correctly, the game is over and may be restarted with a new animal. If the program has
guessed incorrectly, it asks the user for the kind of animal they were thinking of and then asks for the user to provide
a question that can distinguish between its incorrect guess and the correct answer. It then adds the new question and
animal to its "database" and will guess that animal in the future (if appropriate).
